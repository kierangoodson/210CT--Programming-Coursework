[Question 1: Shuffling Arrays]

Copy of code:


(1) def shuffleArray():
    '''A function that randomly shuffles an array. The function takes a random element from
the array and swaps it's position with the element in index 0. It does this for every number in
the array.'''

(1)   array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
(1)   print("The original array: ",array)
(1)   import random
(n)   for i in array:
(n)        randInt = random.randrange(0, len(array))               #randomly selects element in array
(n)        array[0], array[randInt] = array[randInt], array[0]     #swap element at index 0 with the randomly selected element. 
(1)    print ("The randomly shuffled array: ",array)

(1) shuffleArray()

[Question 2:]

Copy of code:


(1)	zeros= 0
(1)	fact = int(input("Input any whole, factorial number and this program will calculate the number of trailing zeros it has: "))

(n)	while fact != 0:                                 #While the factorial isn't equal to zero
(n)    		fact = fact/5                                #factorial = factorial divided by 5
(n)    		zeros = zeros + int(fact)                    #zeros becomes zero + factorial
(1)	print("The number of trailing zeros is : ",zeros)
